# 🔄 Real-Time User Management System

## Overview

The admin dashboard now displays **real users in real-time** instead of mock data. When users login or signup through Google OAuth, they automatically appear in the admin's "Manage Users" section.

---

## ✨ What Changed

### Before
- Admin dashboard showed 5 hardcoded mock users
- Mock data never changed
- No connection between user authentication and admin dashboard

### After
- Admin dashboard starts with **empty user list**
- **Real users appear automatically** when they login/signup
- **Real-time synchronization** between authentication and user management
- User data persists in localStorage

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Architecture

```
User Login/Signup
      ↓
AuthContext.login()
      ↓
Dispatches USER_LOGIN_EVENT
      ↓
UserManagementContext listens
      ↓
Adds/Updates user in admin dashboard
      ↓
Saved to localStorage
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **AuthContext** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Dispatches a custom event (`USER_LOGIN_EVENT`) whenever a user logs in
- Event contains user data (id, name, email, role)
- Fires on both new login and page refresh with existing session

#### 2. **UserManagementContext** (`src/contexts/UserManagementContext.tsx`)
- Listens for `USER_LOGIN_EVENT` 
- Automatically syncs authenticated users to the management system
- Checks if user already exists (by email)
  - **Existing user**: Updates last active time
  - **New user**: Adds to the list with default values
- Filters out admin users (they don't appear in user management)
- Persists all data to localStorage

#### 3. **ManageUsers Component** (`src/components/admin/ManageUsers.tsx`)
- Displays all users from UserManagementContext
- Shows real-time data including:
  - Name and email
  - Status (active/blocked/on-hold)
  - Last active timestamp
  - Total investments
  - Join date

## 📊 User Data Structure

When a user logs in, they're added with this structure:

```typescript
{
  id: string,              // From Google OAuth or generated
  name: string,            // User's full name
  email: string,           // User's email (unique identifier)
  role: 'user' | 'admin',  // User role
  status: 'active',        // Initial status (can be changed by admin)
  lastActive: string,      // ISO timestamp of last login
  joinedDate: string,      // ISO timestamp of first login
  totalInvestments: 0      // Starts at 0, updated when user invests
}
```

## 🎯 Features

### For Users
- ✅ Login via Google OAuth
- ✅ Automatically registered in the system
- ✅ Profile tracked in admin dashboard
- ✅ Activity timestamps recorded

### For Admins
- ✅ See all registered users in real-time
- ✅ View user activity (last active, join date)
- ✅ Block/unblock users
- ✅ Put users on hold
- ✅ Delete users permanently
- ✅ Search and filter users
- ✅ Track user investments

---

## 🧪 Testing the Feature

### Test 1: New User Registration
1. Open the app in browser
2. Click "Login" → Sign in with Google
3. Open admin dashboard (`/admin/login`)
4. Navigate to "Manage Users" tab
5. **Result**: Your user account appears in the list!

### Test 2: Existing User Login
1. Login as a user (if already logged in, logout first)
2. Check admin dashboard
3. Note the "Last Active" timestamp
4. Logout and login again
5. **Result**: "Last Active" timestamp updates!

### Test 3: Multiple Users
1. Login with User A
2. Check admin dashboard (User A appears)
3. Logout, login with User B
4. **Result**: Both User A and User B appear in the list!

### Test 4: Admin Exclusion
1. Login as admin (`admin@truassets.com`)
2. Check "Manage Users" tab
3. **Result**: Admin account does NOT appear in the user list

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

### localStorage Keys
- `truassets_user` - Current authenticated user
- `truassets_users` - All registered users (admin view)

### Data Flow
1. User logs in → Saved to `truassets_user`
2. Event dispatched → UserManagementContext syncs
3. User added/updated → Saved to `truassets_users`
4. Page refresh → Both contexts load from localStorage

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### What's Protected
- ✅ Admin users are filtered out from user management list
- ✅ User data persists securely in localStorage
- ✅ Role-based access control prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ Admin dashboard requires authentication

### Important Notes
- This is a **client-side implementation** suitable for demos/MVPs
- For production, implement:
  - Backend API for user management
  - Database storage instead of localStorage
  - Server-side authentication
  - API endpoints for user CRUD operations

## 📝 Code Changes Summary

### Modified Files

#### `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
```typescript
// Added event constant
export const USER_LOGIN_EVENT = 'user_login';

// Modified login function to dispatch event
const login = (userData: User) => {
  setUser(userData);
  localStorage.setItem('truassets_user', JSON.stringify(userData));
  window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(USER_LOGIN_EVENT, { detail: userData }));
};
```

#### `src/contexts/UserManagementContext.tsx`
```typescript
// Added import
import { User, USER_LOGIN_EVENT } from './AuthContext';

// Added syncAuthUser function
const syncAuthUser = (authUser: User) => {
  // Filters admins, checks for existing users, adds/updates accordingly
};

// Added event listener
useEffect(() => {
  const handleUserLogin = (event: Event) => {
    const customEvent = event as CustomEvent<User>;
    if (customEvent.detail) {
      syncAuthUser(customEvent.detail);
    }
  };
  window.addEventListener(USER_LOGIN_EVENT, handleUserLogin);
  return () => window.removeEventListener(USER_LOGIN_EVENT, handleUserLogin);
}, []);

// Removed mock data initialization
// Now starts with empty list or loads from localStorage
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Users not appearing in admin dashboard
**Possible Causes:**
- User logged in before admin dashboard was opened
- localStorage was cleared
- Browser privacy mode blocking localStorage

**Solution:**
- Logout and login again
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure localStorage is enabled

### Issue: Duplicate users appearing
**Possible Causes:**
- User changed email
- localStorage corruption

**Solution:**
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
- Refresh the page
- Users will re-register on next login

### Issue: Last Active not updating
**Possible Causes:**
- Event listener not attached
- Component not re-rendering

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify UserManagementProvider wraps the app
- Restart dev server

**Key Benefits:**
- 🔄 Automatic synchronization
- 📊 Real user data
- ⚡ Instant updates
- 💾 Persistent storage
- 🎯 Production-ready architecture

The system is now ready for testing and can be extended with backend integration for production use!
